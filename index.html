            <p class="pitch-headline"><strong>Insurance.com sold for $35.6 million in 2010. Why?</strong></p>

            <p>Because when people want insurance, they type "insurance" into a browser. Not "insure." Not "insurence." <strong>Insurance.</strong> The obvious word wins.</p>

            <blockquote class="pitch-question">In the very near future, personal AIs will be far bigger than the Internet and the personal computer revolution combined.</blockquote>

            <p>The information age needed a PC on every desk. The AI age will have an AI in every pocket.</p>

            <p>Right now we're building massive AIs that think at industrial scale. But that power will distribute downward—just like mainframes became PCs. Your personal AI will tap into those big models when needed, but keep your data yours. No cloud mining your conversations.</p>

            <p>Your AI will be your companion. Your confidant. Your diary that talks back. An assistant who knows you, a muse who challenges you, a friend who's always there. It will be a camera on your lapel, and a massive resource in your pocket. Your AI will need a name and the simplier the name the more sought after it will be. Think real names like "Claude.ai," not "Assistant_v2.4.1.megacorp.com/{some arbitrary username}"</p>

            <p class="pitch-closing"><strong>These AI domain names are for sale.</strong> These are names consumers will actually remember, want, and use. And they are are not $35.6 million . . . yet.</p>
